# COVID-19 Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data from Italy to understand the trends and patterns of the pandemic. The analysis includes various aspects such as daily cases, deaths, testing rates, and month-wise trends.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis includes daily COVID-19 statistics for Italy. It contains information such as date, new cases, new deaths, new tests, total cases, total deaths, total tests, and more.

## Files
- **italy-covid-daywise.csv**: Raw data file containing COVID-19 statistics for Italy.
- **locations.csv**: Additional data file containing location information.
- **data-analysis.ipynb**: Colab Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis.
- **results.csv**: Output file containing summarized COVID-19 data with calculated metrics.

## Analysis
The analysis is divided into several sections:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, converting data types, and merging datasets.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Exploring the dataset, visualizing trends, and computing metrics.
3. **Merging Data from Other Sources**: Incorporating additional location data and performing analysis.
4. **Visual Analysis**: Plotting graphs to visualize COVID-19 trends over time and by month.

## Usage
To reproduce the analysis:
1. Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries installed (pandas, matplotlib).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Run the `data-analysis.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter/Colab or any compatible environment.

## Results
